📝Interpolate Google Docs files using mustaches and formatters

[![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Errorname/google-docs-mustaches.svg)](https://github.com/Errorname/google-docs-mustaches/blob/master/LICENSE)

## How does this work?

**google-docs-mustaches** will execute requests to the [Google Drive](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-sdk) and [Google Docs](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/how-tos/overview) APIs to copy the file and interpolate its placeholders using the given data.

## Installation

```sh
npm install google-docs-mustaches
```

## Basic usage

Create a new Google Doc file and write the following text:

```
Hello {{ firstname }} {{ lastname | uppercase }}!

You have {{ accounts[0].money }}€ in you account...
```

Then execute the following code

```js
import Mustaches from 'google-docs-mustaches'

const mustaches = new Mustaches({
  token: () => gapi.auth.getToken().access_token
})

// ID of the template
const source = '11rGORd6FRxOGERe7fh6LNQfyB48ZvOgQNH6GScK_FfA'

// ID of the destination folder
const destination = '18mcqwbaXS8NOqZjztB3OUQAc5_P8M6-l'

mustaches.interpolate({
  source,
  destination,
  data: {
    firstname: 'Thibaud',
    lastname: 'Courtoison',
    accounts: [{ money: 1500 }]
  }
})
```

## Documentation

- [Constructor](#new-mustachesoptions-constructoroptions)
- [Interpolate](#mustachesinterpolateoptions-interpolationoptions-id) the file
- [Discovery](#mustachesdiscoveryoptions-discoveryoptions-placeholder) of the placeholders
- [Export](#mustachesexportoptions-exportoptions-id) of the file

### `new Mustaches(options: ConstructorOptions)`

```ts
type AccessToken = string

interface ConstructorOptions {
  token: () => AccessToken
}
```

- `token` will be called at every request to the Google apis.

> **AccessToken** must have the following scopes:
>
> - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
> - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents

See also: [How to retrieve the Google token?](#how-to-retrieve-the-google-token)

### `mustaches.interpolate(options: InterpolationOptions): ID`

This method will interpolate from the `source` file and put the generated file into the `destination` folder.

```ts
type ID = string

interface InterpolationOptions {
  source: ID
  destination?: ID
  name?: string
  data: Object
  formatters?: Formatters
  strict?: boolean
}

interface Formatters {
  [name: string]: Formatter
}

type Formatter = (value: any, ...params: any[]) => string
```

- `source` is the ID of the file which will be interpolated.
- `destination` is the ID of the destination folder where the new file will be put. If no destination is given, the new file will be put next to the `source` file.
- `name` is the name of the newly created and interpolated google doc file.
- `data` is the data given for the [interpolation](#interpolation)
- `formatters` will be used for [interpolation](#interpolation)
- `strict` indicates whether to use [strict mode](#strict-mode) or not.

### `mustaches.discovery(options: DiscoveryOptions): Placeholder[]`

This methods returns all the placeholders found in the `source` file. The placeholders will be interpolated to see what would have been the results if `interpolate` was called. This method will **not** mutate your source file, nor create a new one.

```ts
interface DiscoveryOptions {
  source: ID
  data?: Object
  formatters?: Formatters
  strict?: boolean
}
```

- `source` is the ID of the file which will be interpolated.
- `data` is the data given for the [interpolation](#interpolation)
- `formatters` will be used for [interpolation](#interpolation)
- `strict` indicates whether to use [strict mode](#strict-mode) or not.

### `mustaches.export(options: ExportOptions): ID`

This methods will copy a file into the mimeType given in argument. The method will return the id of the newly created file.

```ts
interface ExportOptions {
  file: ID
  mimeType: MimeType
  name?: string
  destination?: ID
}

enum MimeType {
  pdf = 'application/pdf',
  text = 'plain/text'
}
```

- `file` is the ID of the file which will be exported.
- `mimeType` is the type to export the file to.
- `name` is the name of the newly exported file.
- `destination` is the ID of the destination folder where the new file will be put. If no destination is given, the new file will be put next to the `file` to given in argument.

> Note: This feature is not working in Node (See [#9](https://github.com/Errorname/google-docs-mustaches/issues/9))

## Interpolation

### Mustaches

The **double brackets** notation (also known as **mustaches**) is used to define placeholders:

```
My name is {{ firstname }}. Nice to meet you!
```

During the interpolation, the placeholder will be replaced with the content of the `options.data` object.

```js
{
  firstname: 'Thibaud'
}
```

```
My name is Thibaud. Nice to meet you!
```

### Path notation

You can use **nested objects and arrays** for the interpolation:

```
{{ pokemons[1].name }}, I choose you!
```

With the following `options.data`

```js
{
  pokemons: [
    {
      name: 'Eevee',
      level: 12
    },
    {
      name: 'Pikachu',
      level: 25
    }
  ]
}
```

Will become:

```
Pikachu, I choose you!
```

_Warning: If you use an undefined variable as input, it will be resolved as an empty string. See [Strict mode](#strict-mode)_

### Formatters

You can use **formatters** to print your data and **more complex objects** any way you want.
In addition of the input variable, they can accept parameters which can be of the following primitive types: Number, Boolean, String or can be a variable which will be evaluated from `options.data`.

There is a number of available formatters, but you can also **write your owns** in `options.formatters`.

```
Hi {{ name | uppercase }}. Today is {{ today | printDay('en-US') }}, tomorrow is {{ tomorrow | printDay('en-US') }}.
```

With the following `options`:

```js
{
  data: {
    name: "Courtoison",
    today: new Date(),
    tomorrow: new Date(new Date().setDate(new Date().getDate()+1))
  },
  formatters: {
    printDay: (date, locale) => date.toLocaleDateString(locale,{weekday: 'long'})
  }
}
```

Will become:

```
Hi COURTOISON. Today is Tuesday, tomorrow is Wednesday.
```

**Available formatters:**

- **lowercase**: `HeLLo` => `hello`
- **uppercase**: `wOrLd` => `WORLD`
- **capitalize**: `heLLO wOrlD` => `Hello World`
- **money(locale, currencyISO, fractionDigits = 0)**: `1500 | money("us", "USD", 2)` => `$1500.00`. (Currency ISO Codes)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes]
- **image(width, height)**: Transform an url string to an image
- _More to come..._

_Warning: If you use an undefined formatter it will be simply ignored, which could lead to unexpected results if you're chaining them. See [Strict mode](#strict-mode)_

### Strict mode

By default, _google-docs-mustaches_ is failing safely, which means that you don't have to worry about using an undefined variable or an unknow formatter, the generated errors will be catched and treated by the program itself. However, you might face unexpected behaviour if for example, you chain several formatters and one of them is misspelled, it would be ignored and the output of your formatters pipeline won't match your expectations.

To avoid this, we provide a strict mode for `.interpolate` and `.discovery`. Instead of using an empty string or your fallback when encountering an undefined variable, it will throw an exception, aborting immediately the interpolation of your document.
